# Restaurant Management System

This repository contains a Django-based restaurant management system. I created a few project-level files to improve organization and clarity.

Next steps you may want:
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Run the server with `python manage.py runserver` inside an activated virtualenv.
- Let me know if you want me to centralize Django settings or restructure apps into `src/`.
